                            <p>When's the last time you've had an Italian soda? It had been a while for me, but I wanted
                                to join my friend for a non-caffeinated beverage at Bytes and I became reaquainted with
                                the combination of fizzy water and artificial fruit syrup. Italian sodas are not so
                                sweet as a normal soda and not so boring as a flavored carbonated water. The Italian
                                sodas at Bytes also have no cream in them (or maybe they do if you ask; I haven't
                                tried), which makes it a nice coffee shop alternative for the times when you're feeling
                                a refreshing drink that doesn't have caffeine or milk.

                                Recommendation: Raspberry Italian soda</p>

                            <p>Nubz is cafe/bar newly opened in sector 26. The interiors are done well with a mixture of
                                modern age designing with classic old school comfort.
                                The place is divided into three areas basically which is the indoor lounge, the outdoor
                                and rooftop seating.
                                The inner seating area is shady and gives a classic tone to the restaurant where as the
                                outdoor seating is comparatively more modern with Graffiti's and funky wall frames.
                                An ideal place to chill and relax.

                                Coming to the food i got a chance to try a wide spread from the menu.
                                Veg starters.
                                Tandoori momos
                                Crispy shittake mushrooms
                                Paneer tikka kaali Mirch
                                Wok tossed veggies
                                Cheese garlic bread
                                Veg gallauti kebab

                                Recommendation: Classic Milk Tea with tapioca + an order of popcorn chicken.</p>

                            <p>I can't tell you whether CoHo has a particularly amazing Vanilla Bean Latte, only because
                                CoHo is the only place I've ever ordered a Vanilla Bean Latte from. I'm not even totally
                                sure I know what a Vanilla Bean Latte is supposed to taste like. What I do know is the
                                Vanilla Bean Latte I ordered on a whim from CoHo was delicious.

                                Recommendation: Vanilla Bean Latte</p>

                                line. Nexus Cafe has plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, too, so on the next sunny
                                day, take a break on the patio with a cup of agua fresca, and maybe a burrito.
