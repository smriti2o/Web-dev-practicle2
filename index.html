                                counterparts, and while they aren't exact matches per se, they're tasty in their own
                                right. Take Elixir No. 1 for example: It's described as a “beautifully bitter booze-free
                                pomegranate cocktail inspired by the Negroni, infused with rhodiola to lift you up,”
                                with a tartness that's unexpected but nonetheless tasty.</p>

                            <p>Iced tea is a form of cold tea. Though usually served in a glass with ice, it can refer
                                to any tea that has been chilled or cooled. It may be sweetened with sugar, syrup and/or
                                apple slices. Iced tea is also a popular packaged drink and can be mixed with flavored
                                syrup, with multiple common flavors including lemon, raspberry, lime, passion fruit,
                                peach, orange, strawberry, and cherry.</p>

                            <p>Mocha is an intensely flavorful coffee blend. It's an espresso-based drink that has the
                                same ingredients of your favorite coffee drinks, such as the cappuccino and latte, which
                                contains steamed milk, a shot or two of espresso, and chocolate.
                                The mocha is very closely related to the classic latte, which began to surge in
                                popularity in the 1980s in the United States.</p>
