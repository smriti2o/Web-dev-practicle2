                        <div>
                            <p>Evernote is a note-taking app that can help you go paperless by replacing handwritten
                                notes with virtual notebooks. You can create new notes, record audio files, attach PDF
                                documents, and more. You can even scan your old notes and course materials and easily
                                digitize them. Evernote also lets you save websites for offline access and highlight or
                                annotate them, and share selected notes with other users. The downside to Evernote is
                                that you'll have to upgrade to sync more than two devices or upload more than 60 MB per
                                month.
